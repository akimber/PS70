# WEEK 2: 2D Design & Cutting
#### Overview

This week, learned how to use the vinyl and laser cutter. They were much easier tools than I expected, especially compared to printing normally at Harvard. The one trick to the laser cutter than I'm not entirely sure if I've mastered yet is managing kerf with a material that's not completely uniform, and how to account for that in Fusion 360.

#### Following The Tutortial

I had done some CAD before in high shool, and taught myself photoshop, so I wasn't intimidated by Fusion 360. It had a simple and familiar interface (I cannot remember which program I used before) so it wasn't difficult to follow the tutorial I found on the general PS70 website:

#### Press-fit Construction Kit

My initial trial for the press-fit construction kit was simply copying the shape of the squares in the tutorial to learn how the laser cutter worked. The squares were a bit loose because I estimated the width of the cardboard to be 4.5mm instead of actually measuring the correct 4.3mm.

I returned to Fusion 360 with a different shape in mind. I chose circles with 3 points of connection, and adjusted the width of the slits to 4.2mm for a snug fit. When I produced them in the laser cutter, they fit nicely and I felt confident that I could drop them and they wouldn't fall apart.

#### Assembly Practice

I wanted to make a more interesting press-fit construction kit than jsut circles or squares, and I impulsively thought of the idea for a car and decided I would try to make one. My goal was to make one where the wheels could turn, but in hindsight, cardboard is not the best material for mobile objects. In Fusion 360, I used the assembly tool to check how my pieces fit together before I wasted material in the laser cutter. I was able to find a lot of errors in my original design this way, including the square pieces that would keep the wheels from turning.

I ended up producing a car that fits together, but it doesn't move like I wanted it to, and also some of the connection points are loose because I designed it with movement in mind. If I were to do this again, I would definitely use a different material than cardboard and include more joints so i could get a snug fit.
