# WEEK 1: INTRODUCTION
#### HTML & CSS

This week, I familiarized myself somewhat with HTML and CSS. I have very limited experience coding (in any language), so I initially spent most of my time trying to read the code in our template files. I realized pretty quickly that I couldn't learn anything about the language until I tried to make changes. At first, I only had the guts to change a few font colors. Then, I became a bit more ~bold~ and started adding text, pages, and changing fonts altogether.

Once I was comfortable with the code that was given to us, I wanted to try to personalize the website further. I googled how to turn an image into a link so that my homepage wasn't cluttered with words. This is the code I ended up using to do that:

![image of code for turning a picture into a link](./imglinkcode.png)

I also wanted to use a background image rather than having a plain white background on my home page. I tried to google this as well but couldn't figure out exactly how to fit what I found into the code we were working from, so I looked at previous PS70 pages. I found this trick by inspecting the remnants of a website from Michael Zhang:

As the weeks go by, I plan to continue making stylistic changes to the website. Currently, I understand how it functions and can use it, but I'd like to do something similar to a page I've made using Adobe Portfolio templates because it looks more professional. I'd like to avoid taking long chunks of code from other websites though, mainly because I want to understand everything that's I have here first. My next changes will probably be to learn how to make scroll boxes within a page and have images show when the mouse is hovered over them by becoming slighlty bigger. 

####FINAL PROJECT IDEAS
#####Robo-pufferfish

I recently toured an engineering firm near my hometown that was tackling many unique projects, but one that really caught my attention was their robotic jellyfish. The applications of this robot would be to moniter foreign military activity in the ocean while remaining largely undetectable. As cool as the idea sounded, I couldn't help but think that if these engineers did their job too well, they might confuse some sea turtles. After all, if sea turtles eat plastic bags that don't look like jellyfish, what's going to stop them from going after a silicone replica of one? I tried thinking of an aquatic organism that doesn't have any natural predators, and my mind got hung up on one thing: pufferfish. 

My proposed robo-pufferfish would serve the same purpose as a robo-jellyfish, but if it makes physical contact with something in the ocean it would have a self defense mechanism and puff itself up to avoid being eaten by a hungry predator. Its basic functions would be to swim in water and expand on impact.

#####Armadillo

Have you ever wanted an armadillo as a pet, but were too afraid of leprosy to ever get near one? Look no further, for this robotic replica of an armadillo will not transmit Hansen's disease, but it *will* look adorable and roll up into a ball to protect itself when in danger. This robot will "walk" on four feet, (or wheels, I haven't decided yet), curl up behind armored plates when it comes into contact with something other than the floor, and unfold itself a few seconds after the threat is removed. It's purpose is to be an artistic and technological endeavor, and conveniently it will also serve as a nice companion in your daily life.

#####Squid-Inspired Necklace

I've seen many ideas out there for gadgets that can help prevent sexual assault, including nail polish that changes color if a drink has been drugged and female condoms with spikes that would latch onto an unwelcome assailant. I'd like to add my idea to the mix. This ring-necklace combo would work both to deter an assaulter and mark them so they can be identified later. The necklace would contain a substance that 1) smells horrendous to keep people away from the victim and the attacker (potential substances include otter musk and skunk spray) and 2) releases ink, similar to the kind found in clothing tags, that stain the skin of the attacker. For the purposes of this class, I would just use water. The ring would connect to the necklace via bluetooth and trigger the release of the ink when the user pressed their thumb to it. This way, if the victim's wrists are pinned down, they can use the necklace with one hand. This idea has limitations due to its size - necklaces and rings are both small objects and the materials we use in class might be difficult to scale down so significantly.
