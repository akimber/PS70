### FINAL PROJECT

#####Robo-pufferfish

I recently toured an engineering firm near my hometown that was tackling many unique projects, but one that really caught my attention was their robotic jellyfish. The applications of this robot would be to moniter foreign military activity in the ocean while remaining largely undetectable. As cool as the idea sounded, I couldn't help but think that if these engineers did their job too well, they might confuse some sea turtles. After all, if sea turtles eat plastic bags that don't look like jellyfish, what's going to stop them from going after a silicone replica of one? I tried thinking of an aquatic organism that doesn't have any natural predators, and my mind got hung up on one thing: pufferfish. 

My proposed robo-pufferfish would serve the same purpose as a robo-jellyfish, but if it makes physical contact with something in the ocean it would have a self defense mechanism and puff itself up to avoid being eaten by a hungry predator. Its basic functions would be to swim in water and expand on impact.

#####Squid-Inspired Necklace

I've seen many ideas out there for gadgets that can help prevent sexual assault, including nail polish that changes color if a drink has been drugged and female condoms with spikes that would latch onto an unwelcome assailant. I'd like to add my idea to the mix. This ring-necklace combo would work both to deter an assaulter and mark them so they can be identified later. The necklace would contain a substance that 1) smells horrendous to keep people away from the victim and the attacker (potential substances include otter musk and skunk spray) and 2) releases ink, similar to the kind found in clothing tags, that stain the skin of the attacker. For the purposes of this class, I would just use water. The ring would connect to the necklace via bluetooth and trigger the release of the ink when the user pressed their thumb to it. This way, if the victim's wrists are pinned down, they can use the necklace with one hand. This idea has limitations due to its size - necklaces and rings are both small objects and the materials we use in class might be difficult to scale down so significantly.
