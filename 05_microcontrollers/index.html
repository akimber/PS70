# WEEK 5: MICROCONTROLLERS
#### Ideation
This week was the first week where everything was completely new to me. I had never worked with a microcontoller before, I had never built a circuit with a goal in mind, I had never coded anything that had any kind of function, let alone one that connected to a physical circuit. I decided to "play it safe" and make sure I understood the basics of microcontrollers before I tried anything too difficult. With my final project in mind, I came up with a motion largely inspired by what we did in class. I would have 3 components: a button, a light, and a motor. I avoided complicated mechanisms driven by the motor this time - mainly because I didn't want to return to my week 2 contraption or build a new mechanism, but also to focus on the coding and circuit component of the microcontroller.
The idea was for the button to start the motor, which would spin a certain amount, then stop, and when it stops a light would turn on until the button is released. 
It's not directly related to my final project, which is a self defense necklace/ring, but I imagine the coding might be similar. On the ring, there will be a button that triggers a mechanism on the necklace. I image this mechanism being 2 parts - one would "open" the necklace to expose a sac of ink, and the 2nd part would be to "shoot" the ink out. I'm not 100% positive how this mechanism might work yet, but the button, one motion, and another motion seems replicatable (is that a word?).

This is what my circuit looked like when I first hooked it up to the arduino board. 

(insert image of circuit, and sketch of circuit)

I then started coding with arduino. I tried to recall the code we used during class for the motor. Since I was using a small yellow motor, and not a servo motor, rather than stopping the motor based on position, I decided to calculate a time that it should spin roughly halfway around. I wanted to have every trigger in the circuit be based on time. I wanted to work without delays and have one action follow another seamlessly.

First, I coded the motor to spin halfway around after timing with my phone how long a full revolution took at 3.3 Volts. The motor should only start when the button is pressed.

Then, I coded for the LED to turn on after that amount of time, and stay on until the button was released.

Here is a video of the microcontroller in action, from the moment the button is pressed to the moment it is released:

As a side note, I'm getting tired of the placeholder I have for my website currently. I've been sick these last two weeks, which has made it hard to motivate myself to do any work beyond what was absolutely necessary, but I plan on completely revamping this website this weekend so I don't need to do it once things get more stressful later. Hooray for long weekends.
